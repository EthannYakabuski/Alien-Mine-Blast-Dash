ANTS: These enemies will move towards you making 4 decisions per second, get caught on the same square as them and receive 1 damage per frame
FLOWERS: These enemies are a little slower, making 2 decisions per second, they will move towards you until they are in the same row, or column. Once they see you, they will begin to fire large powerful bullets at you dealing 5 damage on contact.
ROBOTS: These deadly enemies will make you plead for mercy. Making 4 decisions per second, they will quickly close the distance and shoot well timed deadly bullets at you from any angle once they are close enough.
